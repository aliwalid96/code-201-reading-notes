# How Websites Are Created
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

###### HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

###### Attributes Tell Us More About Elements
Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
###### Body, Head & Title
body
You met the body element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.
head
Before the  body element you
will often see a head element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a title
element inside the head
element.
title
The contents of the title
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).
### ID Attribute
Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
### Class Attribute
Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external site
### Block Elements
    Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elemen

###### The div and span
 elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

 #### iframes
  cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

  HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.

###### Headers & Footers
    The header and footer 
elements can be used for:
1. The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
2. header or footer for an
individual article or
 section within the pag
 ## The nav
  element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

# when youu creat a website you have to understand 
1. Who is the Site For?
Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is

2. What Your Visitors areTrying to Achieve
3. What Information Your Visitors Need
4. How Often People Will Visit Your Site
    ## Site Maps
    Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.
## WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

## grouping and Similarity
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

###### JavaScripts 
1. ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML pag
2. You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them.
3. You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page
4. You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred

# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS 
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it
FROM STEPS
TO CODE
Every step for every task shown
in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can
understand and follow. 
# DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT
Consider how you might approach a different type of script.
This example calculates the cost of a name plaque.
Customers are charged by the letter.
COMPUTERS CREATE
MODELS OF THE WORLD
USING DATA 
# OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
If you could not see the picture of the hotel and cars, the data in the
information boxes alone would still tell you a lot about this scene. 

##### EVENTS
In the real world, people interact with objects. These interactions can
change the values of the properties in these objects. 
There are common ways in which people interact
with each type of object. For example, in a car a
driver will typically use at least two pedals.

####  METHODS
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.
##### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML
page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the
HTML code and applies styling to it
##### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
Before diving into the JavaScript language, you
need to know how it will fit together with the
HTML and CSS in your web pages.
