# Text
When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
## Headings 
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6
the most important title use h1 and the less is h6
## Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening p tag and closing /p tag.

## Bold & Italic
1. b is bold with end tag 
2. i is italic 
## Superscript & Subscrip
1. The sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript
2. The sub element is used to contain characters that shouldbe subscript. 

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
1. br: to break the line 
2. hr: To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the hr  tag.
## Strong & Emphasis
1. strong : The use of the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.
2.  em:  element indicates emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.
## Quotations
1. blockquote : The blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the p element is still used inside the blockquote element. 
2. The q element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the q element, however Internet Explorer does not — therefore many people avoid using the q element.

## Abbreviations & Acronyms
1. abbr :If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the abbr element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

## Author Details
1. address:The address element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.

## Changes to Conten
ins & del & s
The ins element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the del element can show text that has been deleted from it.
The s element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted)
    
# CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
the selector is the html elenmt
decleration is the style 
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

## Using External CSS
 by The link element can be used in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the head element. It should use three attributes:
1. href
2. type
3. rel

## Using Internal CSS
### style 
You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a style element, which usually sits inside the head element of the page.

Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

# JS 
 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon

 You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs

## DATA TYPES 
1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
2. STRING DATA TYPE 
3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE 
## ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values

CREATING AN ARRAY
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array). 
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

## OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values
## ARITHMETI C OPERATORS 

JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class. 
## STRING OPERATOR 
here is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it
# comparion operator 
(== ,!= ,=== ,!==,>=,>,<=,<)
## logical operator 
(&& ,||,!)
## USING IF STATEMENTS
