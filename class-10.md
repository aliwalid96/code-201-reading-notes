# Images
You can control the size of an 
image using the width and 
height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box. 

### AligNing images Using CSS
n the last chapter, you saw how 
the float property can be used 
to move an element to the left or 
the right of its containing block, 
allowing text to flow around it


Rather than using the <img>
element's align attribute, web 
page authors are increasingly 
using the float property to align 
images. There are two ways that 
this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added 
to the class that was created to 
represent the size of the image
2. New classes are created with 
names such as align-left or 
align-right to align the images 
to the left or right of the page. 
These class names are used in 
addition to classes that indicate 
the size of the image.

### Centering images Using CSS
By default, images are inline 
elements. This means that they 
flow within the surrounding text. 
In order to center an image, it 
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. 
Once it has been made into a 
block-level element, there are 
two common ways in which you 
can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element, 
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can 
use the use the margin property 
and set the values of the left and 
right margins to auto.

### Background Images

The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.
