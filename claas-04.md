# Writing Links

Links are created using the <a\> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a\> tag and the closing </a\> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute

## Linking to Other Sites
Links are created using the <a\>
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site
When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.

## Relative URLs

 Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.
## Email Links

To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a\>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to
## Opening Links in a New Window
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank

## Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

we declare thefunction by 
fuunction +fuunction name+(resev value ){
return value
}
we call it bt it fuunction name(send vale );
## VARIABLE SCOPE 


The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. 

### How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### Why pair program?
