# Layout

Key Concepts in 
Positioning Elements

##### Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

##### Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.

##### Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom 
and left or right it should be placed.

###### Normal Flow

In normal flow, each block-level 
element sits on top of the next 
one. Since this is the default 
way in which browsers treat 
HTML elements, you do not 
need a CSS property to indicate 
that elements should appear 
in normal flow, but the syntax 
would be:
######  position: static

##### Relative Positioning

1. position:relative
Relative positioning moves an 
element in relation to where it 
would have been in normal flow.
For example, you can move it 10 
pixels lower than it would have 
been in normal flow or 20% to 
the right.
You can indicate that an element 
should be relatively positioned 
using the position property 
with a value of relative.
2. position:absolute
When the position property 
is given a value of absolute, 
the box is taken out of normal 
flow and no longer affects the 
position of other elements on 
the page. (They act like it is not 
there.) 
The box offset properties (top
or bottom and left or right) 
specify where the element 
should appear in relation to its 
containing element.
3. position:fixed
Fixed positioning is a type 
of absolute positioning that 
requires the position property 
to have a value of fixed.
It positions the element in 
relation to the browser window. 
Therefore, when a user scrolls 
down the page, it stays in the 
exact same place. It is a good 
idea to try this example in your 
browser to see the effect.
To control where the fixed 
position box appears in relation 
to the browser window, the box 
offset properties are used.
## Floating Elements
float

he float property allows you 
to take an element in normal 
flow and place it as far to the 
left or right of the containing 
element as possible.
Anything else that sits inside 
the containing element will 
flow around the element that is 
floated.

### Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.
### Screen Resolution

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens

### Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web 
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

#### Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout 
designs do not 
change size as the 
user increases 
or decreases 
the size of their 
browser window. 
Measurements tend 
to be given in pixels.
### CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch
