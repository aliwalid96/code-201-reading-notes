# image
A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

you can ad image by <img\>
To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img\>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
1. src:This tells the browser whereit can find the image file
2. alt:his provides a text descriptionof the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

#### Height & Width of Images
You will also often see an <img\>
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:
height
width

##### Image Resolution
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file

Animated GIFs
Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

###### HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption
figure
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated. 

# color 
## Foreground Color

1. rgb values

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2.  hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3. color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
## Background Color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

### CSS3: Opacity
### opacity, rgba

CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees)

1. Pixels
2. Percentages
3. Ems

Understanding Font Format

to supply the font in several
variations to reach all browsers.

2. lowercase
3. capitalize
###### Underline & Strike

text-decoration
1. none
2. underline
3. overline

you to control the alignment of
text. The property can take one
of four values:
1. left
This indicates that the text
should be left-aligned.
2. right
This indicates that the text
should be right-aligned.
3. center
