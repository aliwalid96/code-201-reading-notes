# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names
IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME
KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property. Properties tell us about the object, such as
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
Each individual hotel might have a different name
and a different number of rooms.

IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME
KNOWN AS METHODS
If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.
Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object.

Like variables and named functions, 
properties and methods have a 
name and a value. In an object, 
that name is called a key. 

An object cannot have two keys 
with the same name. This is 
because keys are used to access 
their corresponding values. 
The value of a property can be a 
string, number, Boolean, array, or 
even another object. The value of a 
method is always a function.

LITERAL NOTATION 


The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

##### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE 
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. 
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. 
It consists of four main types of nodes. 

Each node is an object with methods and properties. 
Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file). 
Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser. 
##### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 
1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with. 
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

ACCESSING ELEMENTS 

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, 
which is a collection of nodes.

#####  ACCESS & UPDATE A TEXT  NODE WITH NODEVALUE 
When you select a text node, you can retrieve or amend the content of it 
using the node Va 1 ue property.
